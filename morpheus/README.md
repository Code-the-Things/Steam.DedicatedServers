These are files pertinent to implimenting Steam Dedicated servers in Morpheus [Morpheus](https://morpheusdata.com) CMP for orchestration, but should only require minor tweaks to run independently.  Morpheus has a free community license for those looking to run these as is.

Note: These are variablized configuration files placed on the server via Morpheus `File Templates`.
